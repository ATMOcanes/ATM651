Assign [Stuff in Space](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/ShortCourseBook/Chapter1_StuffInSpace.pdf) reading. | Student intros, SI units, power of parentheses T(x,y,z,t), Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694).
Aug30-Sep1 -1	| Compound units: velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux, intensive quantities (___ per unit mass). A few Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 questions. | **Assignment due next Weds**: [HW1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics) called HW1_vectorfield_sketch_withaxes. It has links to Feynman lectures on vectors, vector fields, and their derivatives & integrals. Study that material as needed, and please really try to get this bookkeeping notation clear in your mind. Try to notice any confusions or questions or frustrations, and try to articulate these in class next Wednesday, where we can go over them. (It is finally due next Wednesday at end of day, or later by arrangement if anyone is struggling). 
Week3|LABOR DAY | **HW1 due at end of day, bring questions to class.** For next Wednesday HW2, please write answers to all the Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 questions, showing your work/reasoning/thinking, along with responses to all the Stuff in Space chapter problems -- just so I may glimpse your mind, your voice, please. Lecture: finish Stuff in Space (clarifying [differentiation notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Partial_derivatives)). With gradient and its divergence, we can discuss [Advection and diffusion](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Files_unsorted/Advection_diffusion.demos.pdf) of gray smoke.

Hand out Good Enough Equations (read section 2.1, bring questions). Mainly, we need the First Law of Thermo (2.4) or (2.5). After that, we will transition to Wallace & Hobbs.  | **HW2 due: Stuff in Space probelms, WH Ch1 problems.** Kinematics illustrations and meanings: div <--> dw/dz, d/dt(zeta)=0, and trajectories illustrate deformation.

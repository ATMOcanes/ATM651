Aug 23-25 -1 |zoom.earth and phenomenology and scope, [questionnaire](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM_GradDyn_Intake_Questionnaire.docx). Assign [Stuff in Space](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/ShortCourseBook/Chapter1_StuffInSpace.pdf) reading. | Student intros, SI units, power of parentheses T(x,y,z,t), Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694).
Aug30-Sep1 -1	| Compound units: velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux, intensive quantities (___ per unit mass). A few Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 questions. | **Assignment due next Weds**: [HW1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics) called HW1_vectorfield_sketch_withaxes. It has links to Feynman lectures on vectors, vector fields, and their derivatives & integrals. Study that material as needed, and please really try to get this bookkeeping notation clear in your mind. Try to notice any confusions or questions or frustrations, and try to articulate these in class next Wednesday, where we can go over them. (It is finally due next Wednesday at end of day, or later by arrangement if anyone is struggling). 
Week3|LABOR DAY | **HW1 due at end of day, bring questions to class.** For next Wednesday HW2, please write answers to all the Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 questions, showing your work/reasoning/thinking, along with responses to all the Stuff in Space chapter problems -- just so I may glimpse your mind, your voice, please. Lecture: finish Stuff in Space (clarifying [differentiation notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Partial_derivatives)). With gradient and its divergence, we can discuss [Advection and diffusion](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Files_unsorted/Advection_diffusion.demos.pdf) of gray smoke. 
Sep 12-14 |[Lecture about](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Lecture_Stuff_in_Space_problems.pdf) HW1 slight concerns, and presaging HW2-StuffInSpace part: a closed eq. set, and pressure as the (smooth! inverse-Laplacian) cop enforcing the law of mass continuity. Hand out Good Enough Equations (read section 2.1, bring questions). Mainly, we need the First Law of Thermo (2.4) or (2.5). After that, we will transition to Wallace & Hobbs.  | **HW2 due: Stuff in Space problems, WH Ch1 problems.** Closed set of prognostic equations. The dream of *conservation*, applied to [vorticity](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Conservation_dream_vorticity.jpg) of horizontal flow to avoid thermodynamics. IDV displays show vorticity is pretty well conserved, features move along like air parcel trajectories. But thermo is necessary, so we derived the [First Law](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/FirstLaw_Heatcpacities.jpg). Although it expresses conservation of energy, grr it still isn't conservation form d/dt(warmth) = 0 + Q, we will need a trick! (handed out Good Enough Equations which has the tricks). 
Sep 19-21|Survey situation: rising out of the basement (with this vocabulary [part1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Basement_vocab1.jpg), [part2](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Basement_vocab2.jpg) in hand). Phenomena! [Stationary waves in a river](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Stationary_waves_river.jpg), & ["where did Fiona's vorticity come from?"](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Where_did_Fiona_vort_come_from.jpg)?  **Assign --> Each student please jot down at least one time-stamped question or classroom discussion point.** | Discussed student questions on vorticity [movies](http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html), Parts 1&2. Mentioned [Helmholtz laws](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Helmholtz_vortex_laws_and_viscosity.jpeg). HW2 back, notice [delta function](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/%20Delta_function_whatizzit.jpeg) view of how the hydrostatic part of pressure is still a "cop preventing [the convergent gravity force](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Divergence_of_gravityforce_has_delta_function_at_surface.jpeg) from violating mass continuity". Notice that [centrifugal force is momentum advection](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Centrifugal_force_is_advection_of_momentum.jpeg) and [geostrophic is a terrrible approx in a hurricane!](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/%20Hurricane_wind_geostrophy_terrrrrible_approx.jpeg). 
Sep 26-28	|Hurr. [Ian vorticity](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Friction_Venezuela_Ian2022.png) partly [created by friction](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Friction_term_vorticity_equation.jpg). Looked at WH section 7.1 (kinematics) and parsed [Mingpo's nice nb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QAnKTiUojvxLp029IYFsSq3hhvEouE51#scrollTo=wT-RwDUfG5jK). Point-vortex interactions: same signs orbit, opposite signs promenade like a smoke ring, as each induces [wind V = C/r with distance r](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Tangential_wind_inverse_radius_point_vortex.jpg).  Some IDV shown; for projects, check out the available MERRA2 [data collections](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pubs/docs/Bosilovich785.pdf).  | **Read WH section 7.2.**; Hurricane Ian raging interestingly, and not yet tragically. [Recording, Passcode: !S^yYQm9](https://miami.zoom.us/rec/share/R5z0EVHSbBg05H8a8FLyfh4NtEJeCtEB1TPhwhW3LQnsJxlWfeuFZTd31vpUmczI.V3dYpSvOR9oKhaKg). Wow, landfall rapid-scan vis [video](https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/1575162920912113679)!
Oct 3-5 |[First Law of Thermo](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/GoodEnoughEqs_FirstLaw_staticenergy.pdf) in "Good Enough Equations" handout, noticing the path to entropy & potential temperatures, but preferring the clarity of dry and moist static energy as the 'warmth' variable in d/dt(warmth) = 0 + Q.  You should be preparing for an exam, a lot like this [2019 one](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Files_unsorted/Vocab_midterm_Exam_solutions2019.pdf). Know all the italicized words in Wallace-Hobbs Chs 1,7, and from our other 'basement' work on quantities, units, vector calculus (HW1), Gauss and divergence integral theorems, advection vs. flux form, ...  | Post-Ian gratitude, awe at [video](https://sysadm.aos.wisc.edu/~poker/2022_09_27-29_ian_color_visible.mp4) and [photo](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150427/staring-into-ians-eye). Few more words about d/dt(something)= 0 + complications equations. Discuss any questions for Monday's exam. 
Oct 10-12	|Exam in class 75 minutes (prof out but available on zoom, proctor in room can relay questions)| Can we start turning toward projects yet? If you want to look at data, install IDV and make a NASA account as in [this ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/tree/master/Projects-IDV-MERRA2).

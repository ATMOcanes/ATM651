## Conservation laws d/dt = 0!!! + sources-sinks (“tendencies”)

### PV: conserved even w/ hordiv 

- Huge in stratosphere (static stability part)

- Mainly matters in strat-trop exchanges 

### Momentum

- Horizontal

	- Cartesian tangent plane 

		- vort = v_y - u_x, eliminates PGF 

			- Absolute vort cons: Ro waves

				- Phase west, energy east, equal

				- Goes as wavelength squared

				- Stationary: roughly continent scale wavelength 

			- Relative vort cons: vortex interactions, V goes as 1/r

		- aGeostrophic (non-gradient) wind 

			- Contains almost all of the divergent wind component 

				- Ooze to maintain balance  (QG omega equation)

					- warm advection —> ascent

					- vorticity advection above —> up

				- gravity waves 

				- convection 

				- Frictional down-gradient flow

			- Governs change: dV/dt = fV_a x k

		- “Gradient wind”: along isobars (Thereby almost no divergence)

			- Vertical diff: “Thermal Wind” V_T directed along isotherms 

				- “equivalent barotropic” V_T parallel to isobars 

				- Vg turns with height: temperature advection

			- Gradient: neglect partial_t(V)

			- Geostrophic: neglect d/dt(V)

	- Spherical 

- Vertical in atm.

	- hydrostatic approx.

		- Hypsometric equation relates thickness to T, p

		- Use hyd. p as coordinate

	- Full dw/dt equation 

		- Thermal buoyancy

		- Dynamic pressure 

- 3D in atm.

	- KE: V dot dV/dt eliminates Cor

		- Source: V.PGF

		- Transport

			- Advective

			- Nonadvective 

		- Sink: V.Fri

	- Curl(V): turbulence, tornadoes

- solutions (e.g. instabilities)

	- counterweight: stability (KH)

	- internal vorticity line or sheet rolls up into balls, rolls

- Navier-Stokes: Source = Force

	- PGF: cop enforcing mass continuity 

		- Hydrostatic: fights gravity, prevents collapse on sfc 

		- Geostrophic: fights divergence of Coriolis force 

		- Dynamic: fights divergence of (advection of momentum) 

	- Coriolis if coords rotating

	- Gravity

### Thermo

- Stability & convection logic

	- shear & tornadoes filigree 

	- skew-T, log-p plots (trad)

	- moist conserved plots (logical!)

- Moist conserved

	- Liquid water SE: s - Lq_liq

	- MSE: h = s + Lq_v dh/dt = Qrad + Qmix

- Dry conserved 

	- hydrostatic z(p): static energies 

		- s = C_p T + gz ds/dt = L dq/dt + Qrad + Qmix 

		- Enthalpy (heat content): C_p T 

	- Divide by T: entropy S, potential temperature theta 

		- Moist conserved: theta-e (for equivalent) or -w (wet bulb)

		- Dry conserved: theta = T(1000 hPa /p)^(R/C_p) 

- Temperature

	- Has adiabatic compression term, clearer to convert from conserved vars as needed

	- needed for density (thickness,buoyancy)

## Transport tendencies in d/dt

### Advection -V.del( )

- separate: vertical, horizontal,…

- (equals LS flux convergence, in 3D)

### Convergence of flux 

- flux by Large-Scale (LS) flow

- flux by small scales (down gradient: diffusion, viscosity)

- Area average = flux into perimeter, *zero for globe*

## Continuity of mass in space-time 

### rho_t partial derivative =0 in Anelastic and Boussinesq sets

### rho_t = -div( rho*V ) 

## Vector calculus

### 2D: area <--> perimeter

- Circulation theorem

- Divergence theorem

### 3D Del operator

- Curl of vector field: only in 3D

- Divergence of vector field

- Gradient of scalar field

### *fields* of scalars and vectors 

### Vectors: mag (w/units),direction 

## Partial and total derivatives

### total d/dt in moving coordinate

### partials of T(x,y,z,t), T(x,y,p,t) 

## Quantities and Units 

### Special honorifics (N, J, W, Pa)

-------|------------- | ------------- 
Aug 19-21 |Unpack course title, hand out [questionnaire]([https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM_GradDyn_Intake_Questionnaire.docx](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Intake_questionnaire_fall2024.docx)). | Summer cloud photos, [WH Ch1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/WallaceHobbs-Ch01.pdf) qualitative questions. Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694). We will use [WH book](https://miami.box.com/s/3h7g9x9lym68od76cf3is1yfl48sbrj1) chapter 7 so you can start reading that too. 
Aug26-28 	| Self introductions results & [mine with links](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Intake_questionnaire_fall2024_BEMresponses.docx) Then: math-physics review. Equality. The mighty power of parentheses: functions f(arguments, coordinates), derivatives. Derivative *operator*. Vectors. *Fields* of scalars and vectors. Nabla, the *vector derivative operator*. **Metric Units**: Crafted for us! Earth, Water, Hands (powers of 10). Length, mass, time. Velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux. *Pressure* is a flux of momentum, as is *stress*! | Compund MKS units. Flux: STUFF $m^{-2} s^{-1}$. Mass budget of a control volume, time change = flux in - flux out. Extension to all intensive or *specific* (per unit mass) quantities. **Assignment due next Weds at 11:59pm** to be linked here. Rusty? Read the Feynman lectures on [vectors](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_11.html), [vector field derivatives](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_02.html), [vector field integrals](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_03.html). 
Week3|LABOR DAY |  TRANSPORT, treated as FLUX CONVERGENCE, $' -\nabla \cdot (q \vec V) '$ vs. ADVECTION, $' -\vec V \cdot \nabla q '$

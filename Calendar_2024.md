-------|------------- | ------------- 
Aug 19-21 |Unpack course title, hand out [questionnaire]([https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM_GradDyn_Intake_Questionnaire.docx](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Intake_questionnaire_fall2024.docx)). | Summer cloud photos, [WH Ch1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/WallaceHobbs-Ch01.pdf) qualitative questions. Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694). We will use [WH book](https://miami.box.com/s/3h7g9x9lym68od76cf3is1yfl48sbrj1) chapter 7 so you can start reading that too. 
Aug26-28 	| Self introductions results & [mine with links](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Intake_questionnaire_fall2024_BEMresponses.docx) Then: math-physics review. Equality. The mighty power of parentheses: functions f(arguments, coordinates), derivatives. Derivative *operator*. Vectors. *Fields* of scalars and vectors. Nabla, the *vector derivative operator*. **Metric Units**: Crafted for us! Earth, Water, Hands (powers of 10). Length, mass, time. Velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux. *Pressure* is a flux of momentum, as is *stress*! | Compund MKS units. Flux: STUFF $m^{-2} s^{-1}$. Mass budget of a control volume, time change = flux in - flux out. Extension to all intensive or *specific* (per unit mass, "mass concentration"). **[Assignment](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/HW1_fluxgames_handwritten_small.pdf) due next Weds at end of day**. I will print and hand out a few copies, or here is electronic.  
Week3|LABOR DAY |  $\partial q/ \partial t =$ (Physical Source-Sink) + TRANSPORT TENDENCY, whether expressed as FLUX CONVERGENCE, $' -\nabla \cdot (q \vec V) '$ vs. ADVECTION, $' -\vec V \cdot \nabla q '$. The one hard nut of fluid bookkeeping is being able to intercovert these, and understand them both and it all. Rusty on vector calculus? Penn State link above, or read the Feynman lectures on [vectors](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_11.html), [vector field derivatives](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_02.html), [vector field integrals](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_03.html); a lucid visceral sensibility about all of physics is his style, famously.  
Week 4 | Hand back [HW1 solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM651_Homework_1_solutions.pdf), asking students to polish up and show perfect on parts they missed. Then, show a 2D version of [advection and diffusion with math explanation up front](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Advection_diffusion.withexplanation.pdf). We glimpsed the **Lagrangian or Material derivative d/dt** with the advection wrapped up in it. Saw that we already have 5 out of 6 equations needed for a closed set of six ($\rho,u,v,w,p,T$) variables! Later we will play with these, seeking to create the most powerful and accurate "conservation laws" d/dt(*something*) = 0 .... for conceptual understandings. BUT, only for very special *something*s... | Meaning and power of d/dt, the *material* or Lagrangian time derivative - rates of change following tiny air masses called *parcels*, **not** budgeting local tiny coordinate volumes (control volumes) which is the Eulerian $\frac{ \partial }{ \partial t }$. Next up: Read WH ch 7.1 *Kinematics*, the description of 2D vector fields. The classroom [ppt is here](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WH_chapter7/Kinematics_WH_7.1.pptx).  **HW2 for Weds 9/18 midnight: 1. Copy and work and make a readable version of the [kinematics Python notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lOA8tk9EFLLPIfXM6Q6b_yihDEhve193?usp=sharing), cleaner [with a function](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z9zPnxxPHiRzME7YrcprdgCnogqt1Nil?usp=sharing), on Colab or in your own Jupyter. 2. Convince me you understand each point in the [solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/HW2_vectorfield_sketch_withaxes_solutions.pdf) to this [blank HW2 sheet](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/HW2_vectorfield_sketch_withaxes.pdf), especially that you got the essential points about Gauss and Stokes Theorems in Ch7.** I can recommend doing the whole HW, but will accept more verbal showings that you got the key points.  
Week 5 | Kinematics classroom [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WH_chapter7/Kinematics_WH_7.1.pptx). Any questions? Laser-point some areas where Stokes or Gauss theorems allow us to find mean vorticity or divergence. Assignment for Weds: **Read section 7.2 up to 7.2.5, and 7.3.1-7.3.2**| **HW due** and be prepared to discuss [Section 7.2 ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WH_chapter7/Forces_WH7.2.pptx) if called upon. "Making use of the hydrostatic equation (3.17) and the definitions of geopotential (3.20) and geopotential height (3.22), (more said in sections 7.3.1-7.3.2) the horizontal pressure gradient force becomes..." Note that eliminating density $\rho$ reduces our unknowns to 5! but our equations to 4, as the Ideal Gas Law is implicit. We will still need one for T... **Chapter 7 HW for MONDAY AFTER next Weds end of day:** Read Ch7 to end, [HW3:Ch7 problems, here as .pdf or .doc](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WH_chapter7). 
Week 6 (Sep 23-25)  | Continue Wallace and Hobbs ch7: balanced winds, "thermal wind balance" (hydrostatic AND geostrophic) is the culmination. |  WH ch7 late sections: Gather the primitive equations, do $\vec V \cdot$ them for KE, $\hat k \cdot \vec \nabla \times$ them for vorticity
Week 7 (Sep 30-Oct 2) | **HW due end of day**, in class will answerQ/ do on board. Vorticity movie? | hurricane disaster to talk about?

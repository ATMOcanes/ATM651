Aug 19-21 |Unpack course title, hand out [questionnaire]([https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM_GradDyn_Intake_Questionnaire.docx](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Intake_questionnaire_fall2024.docx)). | Summer cloud photos, [WH Ch1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/WallaceHobbs-Ch01.pdf) qualitative questions. Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694). We will use [WH book](https://miami.box.com/s/3h7g9x9lym68od76cf3is1yfl48sbrj1) chapter 7 so you can start reading that too. 
Aug26-28 	| Self introductions results & [mine with links](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Intake_questionnaire_fall2024_BEMresponses.docx) Then: math-physics review. Equality. The mighty power of parentheses: functions f(arguments, coordinates), derivatives. Derivative *operator*. Vectors. *Fields* of scalars and vectors. Nabla, the *vector derivative operator*. **Metric Units**: Crafted for us! Earth, Water, Hands (powers of 10). Length, mass, time. Velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux. *Pressure* is a flux of momentum, as is *stress*! | Compund MKS units. Flux: STUFF $m^{-2} s^{-1}$. Mass budget of a control volume, time change = flux in - flux out. Extension to all intensive or *specific* (per unit mass, "mass concentration"). **[Assignment](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/HW1_fluxgames_handwritten_small.pdf) due next Weds at end of day**. I will print and hand out a few copies, or here is electronic.  
Week3|LABOR DAY |  $\partial q/ \partial t =$ (Physical Source-Sink) + TRANSPORT TENDENCY, whether expressed as FLUX CONVERGENCE, $' -\nabla \cdot (q \vec V) '$ vs. ADVECTION, $' -\vec V \cdot \nabla q '$. The one hard nut of fluid bookkeeping is being able to intercovert these, and understand them both and it all. Rusty on vector calculus? Penn State link above, or read the Feynman lectures on [vectors](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_11.html), [vector field derivatives](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_02.html), [vector field integrals](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_03.html); a lucid visceral sensibility about all of physics is his style, famously.  
Week 4 | Hand back [HW1 solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM651_Homework_1_solutions.pdf), asking students to polish up and show perfect on parts they missed. Then, show a 2D version of [advection and diffusion with math explanation up front](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Advection_diffusion.withexplanation.pdf). We saw the **Lagrangian or Material derivative d/dt** with the advection wrapped up in it, but still need to clarify its meaning and power. Saw how we already have 5 out of 6 equations needed for a closed set of six ($\rho,u,v,w,p,T$) variables. Having all 6 will be a milestone! Then we will play with them, seeking to create the most powerful and accurate "conservation laws" d/dt(*something*) = 0 .... plus complications we can fruitfully ignore for a while, conceptually. For very special *something*s... | Meaning and power of d/dt, the *material* or Lagrangian time derivative - rates of change following tiny air masses called *parcels*, **not** for local tiny coordinate volumes (control volumes) which is the Eulerian $\frac{ \partial }{ \partial t }$.

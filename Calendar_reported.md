-------|------------- | ------------- 
Aug 23-25 |zoom.earth and IDV walk-through of current weather, student intros| Counting heads: Stuff in Space on hypothes.is. Power of parentheses: T(x,y,z,t). Assigned [HW1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/tree/master/Week%20copy%201), with pointers to Feynman lectures on vectors, vec fields, derivs & integrals. 
30-Sep1	| Ida ideas on how **V**(x,y,z,t) is simpler for hurricanes. HW1 help, aided by this ([vector field grapher](https://user.mendelu.cz/marik/EquationExplorer/vectorfield.html) ), annotated for the integral theorems (Gauss, Stokes). [Whiteboard](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/blob/master/Week%20copy%202/Whiteboard%5B20210830%5D.pdf)| HW1 due. Curl (vorticity) questions, Stokes' theorem lets you answer whichever integral is easier. Game: SI Units from French Revolution. Assign HW2: read all of Stuff in Space, do all problems, due next Weds.  
Week3|LABOR DAY | Transport on whiteboard: Eulerian (control volume at x,y,z) vs. Lagrangian (chain rule) for moving parcel with position x_p(t),y_p(t),z_p(t). An equation set for fluids. What is pressure? HW2 due. Assign reading: WH Ch 0, Ch 7.1. Have answers in class for all qualitative questions (7.5 a-z). If not answers, then questions! Tag questions with hypothes.is annotation. 
13-15	|Wallace and Hobbs Ch7 section 1: Kinematics of 2D flow patterns. [Assignment on colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uY31iYu5dZ5E9F-UoYrpWQf4UnJLvoKG?usp=sharing), due before weekend. | Kinematics illustrations and meanings: div <--> dw/dz, d/dt(zeta)=0, and trajectories illustrate deformation. Read WH Ch7.2 up to 7.2.5. 
20-22   |Discuss [apparent forces](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/blob/master/Week%20copy%205/ApparentForces.pdf), pencil taped to globe. Reading assigned: *through* 7.2.8. **Please make at least one annotation per reading assignment.** Assign HW4 (tags in [hypothes.is group](https://hypothes.is/groups/iMnrZwXz/atm651-2021)), due in 1 week.| A few words on JuPyGitHub ecosystem. Demo Monday at 10:00. Coriolis Force is *real*. Equation of motion **T + C + P + F**, concept of balance. WH ch7 geostrophic, frictional, gradient, etc. Thermal wind. 
27-29	|HW4 due, any problem problems? book qualitative questions. Thermal wind related to temperature advection (WH Fig. [7.14](https://hyp.is/pKoXYh_KEeycHPdhl2DA9w/weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/pagestuff/WallaceHobbs-Ch7.pdf)). | Balanced vortices: warm/cool core cyclones. [Whiteboard photo and ppt here](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/blob/master/Week%20copy%206/2021_Warm-coolCore_Vortices.pptx). Assign vorticity [movies](http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html), Parts 1&2. Please jot at least one time-stamped question or classroom discussion point, perhaps [on the films's own notes document](https://hyp.is/dfl8DgtTEeyLJGc_BsNVhQ/weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/Vorticity_Film_Notes.pdf). 
Oct 4-6	|vorticity, reading+movies: bring time-stamped questions for class| wave words, [Rossby waves (of abs. vort.)](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/blob/master/Week%20copy%207/20211006_Absvort_Rossby_waves.pptx). Words about scale, averages, deviations. Note last years exam/review materials for Monday review for Weds exam
11-13	| review for exam. [5-page green grammar list](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/blob/master/Week%20copy%207/Unit1_Vocab_Exam_Table_reviewdraft.pdf), [WH7 italicized words](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/Vocabulary_WHch7.highlighted_text.pdf), [last year exam solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/Vocab_Exam1_solutions.pdf) | exam (we have enough "grammar" now, turn the corner to logic and rhetoric)
18-20	|**Assign: Read Ch 7.3, ready answers to questions 7.5 m-v.** Ponder project ideas, individual consultations soon. Lecture: [assemble PE set](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/blob/master/Week8_assembling_the_PEs/Whiteboard%5B1%5D.pdf) Hand back Exam and here is its [answer key](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2021/blob/master/Midterm_Exam_Key.pdf)| PE set --> how warm air rises (7 steps!), book fig. 7.21. Then, revisit the First Law of Thermo using the Static Energy trick instead of potential temperatures. *Better, I contend!* **Assign: Read Ch. 7.4-7.5 ready answers to 7.5 from w to end**.

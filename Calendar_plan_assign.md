-------|------------- | -------------
Aug 23-25  | Welcome to grad school. Introductions. Course plans. Software. Assign to read W&H Chapter 1  | Whiteboard: MKS units, coordinates, functions, derivatives.  
30-Sep1	|Reiterate assignment to read W&H Chapter 1 and ponder all its end-of-chapter questions: we will go over all those questions verbally soon. Discuss kinematic "ingredients" of flow fields and assign [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uY31iYu5dZ5E9F-UoYrpWQf4UnJLvoKG?usp=sharing#scrollTo=IWjRtVAGK6Fk).| Words about probability (ensembles = *frequentist*, as one facet of human judgement = *Bayesian*). Then: a vector has direction+magnitude, but can be moved as a trick for adding; vector *fields* have vectors *at every location*. Practiced vector field addition and went over student Colab notebook results. Assignment: read WH ch1 for Monday.
6-8 Sep|LABOR DAY | WH ch1 questions, as advertized. Mass flux as jumping-off point to flux in general (e.g. pressure is a *momentum flux* with units of momentum per unit area per second. Also speak of *Eulerian vs. Lagrangian* time derivatives, whose difference (we shall see) is *advection*.  
13-15	| "Transport": Lagrangian view (*material* derivative d/dt and trajectories). Eulerian view (*partial* time derivative and *local* tendencies) - advection form, flux convergence form. Advection and diffusion.| Vorticity conservation and transport; notice downstream development aspect of current western US extremes. Discuss WH ch7 reading through 7.2.6, students answers to 7.5 a-k, collect HW problems 7.6-7.10. Breakout group IDV exercise on how *trajectores* computed from V(t) data relate to *transport* of *tracer* zeta (vorticity).
|20-22	|Vortex interactions: a game of pinball among Rankine vortices. The pieces of how it relates to HW problems 7.6 and 7.9, and d/dt(conserved)=0, and the Laplacian (*divergence of gradient*, a measure of *curvature*) and its inverse, and current weather, recording link emailed | Vorticity film discussion. Conservation of abs vorticity --> [*Rossby waves*](https://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article/146/7/1965/103117/Rossby-Wave-Packets-on-the-Midlatitude-Waveguide-A) with westward phase speed but eastward group (energy) speed *proportional to wavelength squared*.   
27-29	|Two ways to tackle d/dt(blah) = blah1 + blah2: 1. attack or ignore RHS [("conservation" view)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeNSMJtKGc0); 2. Ignore LHS ("balance", hydrostatic or geostrophic). As we pursue conservation from rel. vorticity to abs. vorticity to *potential vorticity*, first we need *potential temperature* derived here (from First Law).  | Superstorm Teddy visualization (in LMT Contributed folder). Geostrophic, gradient, thermal wind balance. Annotated book pages & problems.
Oct 4-6	|PV, the ultimate conserved variable. Why better than vorticity? 1. If static stability is converted to spin by air columns moving into less-stratified layers (like strat->trop intrusions); 2. Source term is nicely related to heating Q: d(PV)/dt ~ (abs.vor.) dQ/dz. Both illustrated in section 3 of [notebook](https://github.com/Unidata/drilsdown/blob/master/UseCase_Examples/Weather_Event_Case_Study/Superstorm_Teddy_Sep2020.ipynb). | Homework 2 [solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW2_WHproblems_solutions.pdf) review. DRAW DIAGRAMS AND DISCUSS REASONING -- formula plugging is useless busywork. New material: Primitive equations assembled. How do they operate for *hot air rising*? [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-09-29%20PE%20view%20of%20how%20hot%20air%20rises), [HW3](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW3.PE_hotairrises.how.pdf) **due date**
11-13	| HW3 problems discuss, [annotate](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-10-05%20HW3%20primitive%20eqs%20hot%20air%20rises%20), and look at quantitative-problem [solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW6.PE_hotairrises.solns.pdf)| HW3 handed back; whiteboard on how xypt coordinate PE equations differ from xyzt, and vocab review screenshots
18-20	|Review was too slow, but images are now in vocab review link from last Weds.| See "reviewdraft" document with green text for keywords, and study PE memorization exam item
25-27	|Exam in class| Static Energy conservations and assign balloon-sounding instability assignment
Nov 1-3	|Balloon-soundings screen shares and discussion. Current weather (development of Zeta) discussion. | Midlatitude cyclone from Wallace-Hobbs Ch8 [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Wallace_Hobbs_ch8_Nov10_storm.ppt) and **assign for Mon** [LMT5.4 - Sandy case](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/Heatingrates_MERRA_LMTpages.pdf)
8-10	| MERRA heat budget, student assignment shows and tells. Key points: [Analysis tendency](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Class_sessions/2020-11-02_LMT5.4_Tbudget_and_AT/Whiteboard%5B1%5D.pdf), and PBL top | Concept of secondary circulations and ageostrophic flow - unfinished.

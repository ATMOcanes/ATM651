# Calendar (planning, copied initially from last year's reported)

Dates	|Monday	|Wednesday
-------|------------- | -------------
Week1| Welcome to grad school. Introductions. Course GitHub site, Hypothesis, IDV. Read/annotate Mapes sections 1.1-1.2 | Math review: Coordinates, the power of functions: T(x,y,z,t).  Physics review: Units. Assign to read/annotate Feynman on Vectors and Vector Fields.
Week2| SI units. Derivatives and integrals, incl. of vector fields (HW1 help).| Mass flux and mass budget (continuity). From there, anything else per-unit-mass. Enough equations for # of unknowns yet? Assign reading: rest of Stuff in Space. Assign problems from there (HW2). 
Week3|LABOR DAY | Transport: Largangian,Eulerian. An equation set for fluids. What is pressure? HW2 due. Assign reading: WH Ch 0, Ch 7.1.
Week4| "Transport": Lagrangian view (*material* derivative d/dt, tracers and trajectories). Eulerian view (*partial* time derivative and *local* tendencies) - advection form, flux convergence form. Diffusion.| Vorticity as a conserved quantity. Assign MIT films, & to make hypothes.is annotations. 
Week5|Vortex interactions: a game of pinball among Rankine vortices. Vorticity film discussion. | Conservation of abs vorticity --> [*Rossby waves*](https://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article/146/7/1965/103117/Rossby-Wave-Packets-on-the-Midlatitude-Waveguide-A) with westward phase speed but eastward group (energy) speed *proportional to wavelength squared*.   
Week6|Two ways to tackle d/dt(blah) = blah1 + blah2: 1. attack or ignore RHS [("conservation" view)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeNSMJtKGc0); 2. Ignore LHS ("balance", hydrostatic or geostrophic). As we pursue conservation from rel. vorticity to abs. vorticity to *potential vorticity*, first we need *potential temperature* derived here (from First Law).  | Superstorm Teddy visualization (in LMT Contributed folder). Geostrophic, gradient, thermal wind balance. Annotated book pages & problems.
Week7|PV, the ultimate conserved variable. Why better than vorticity? 1. If static stability is converted to spin by air columns moving into less-stratified layers (like strat->trop intrusions); 2. Source term is nicely related to heating Q: d(PV)/dt ~ (abs.vor.) dQ/dz. Both illustrated in section 3 of [notebook](https://github.com/Unidata/drilsdown/blob/master/UseCase_Examples/Weather_Event_Case_Study/Superstorm_Teddy_Sep2020.ipynb). | Homework 2 [solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW2_WHproblems_solutions.pdf) review. DRAW DIAGRAMS AND DISCUSS REASONING -- formula plugging is useless busywork. New material: Primitive equations assembled. How do they operate for *hot air rising*? [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-09-29%20PE%20view%20of%20how%20hot%20air%20rises), [HW3](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW3.PE_hotairrises.how.pdf) **due date**
Week8| HW3 problems discuss, [annotate](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-10-05%20HW3%20primitive%20eqs%20hot%20air%20rises%20), and look at quantitative-problem [solutions](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW6.PE_hotairrises.solns.pdf)| HW3 handed back; whiteboard on how xypt coordinate PE equations differ from xyzt, and vocab review screenshots
Week9|Review was too slow, but images are now in vocab review link from last Weds.| See "reviewdraft" document with green text for keywords, and study PE memorization exam item
Week10|Exam in class| Static Energy conservations and assign balloon-sounding instability assignment
Week11|Balloon-soundings screen shares and discussion. Current weather (development of Zeta) discussion. | Midlatitude cyclone from Wallace-Hobbs Ch8 [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Wallace_Hobbs_ch8_Nov10_storm.ppt) and **assign for Mon** [LMT5.4 - Sandy case](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/Heatingrates_MERRA_LMTpages.pdf)
Week12| MERRA heat budget, student assignment shows and tells. Key points: [Analysis tendency](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Class_sessions/2020-11-02_LMT5.4_Tbudget_and_AT/Whiteboard%5B1%5D.pdf), and PBL top | Concept of secondary circulations and ageostrophic flow - unfinished.
Week 13| [Mind map of atmospheric models](http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/pimms/browser/CASCADE/ControlledVocabs/trunk/Software/Atmosphere_bdl.mm?rev=48&order=size). Concept of secondary circulations and ageostrophic flow - continued. Assigned take-home final HW. |Concept of secondary circulations and ageostrophic flow - continued.

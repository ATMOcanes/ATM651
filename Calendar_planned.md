How do they operate for *hot air rising*? [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/tree/master/Class_sessions/2020-09-29%20PE%20view%20of%20how%20hot%20air%20rises), [HW3](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW3.PE_hotairrises.how.pdf) **due Monday 5 October**
5-7 Oct	|**HW3 (due at midnight).** Look at upcoming exam (vocabulary review). | Wrap up Ch7. Consider all its conceptual questions 7.5. More vocab exam review. Budgets of equation sets: MERRA2. 
12-14	|Exam review: vocabulary - form/units - concepts - sketches linkages | Exam review  
19-21	| Exam| Some [Project Ideas](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/ProjectIdeas.md). Conserved variables and their use in the logic of vertical instability for moist convection. Word doc [assignment](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/HW4_MSEplots_soundings.docx); read book [explanation of conserved energy-mass diagrams](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/Chapter4_LiftedParcelBuoy.pdf).  Due next Monday, we will show everyone's examples in class. 
26-28	|  go over people's homeworks (soundings), discussion	| WH ch8 midlatitude cyclone [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Wallace_Hobbs_ch8_Nov10_storm.ppt); heating rates and T budget terms. **Assign for Mon** [do lab and answer its questions, but for LMT5.4_Sandy bundle](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/Heatingrates_MERRA_LMTpages.pdf) in MapesIDV->AMS_LMT_labs in your favorites folder. You need to accept a couple IDV errors while it loads. 
2-4 Nov	| Examine LMT5.4 results (T budget terms). **Assignment For next Monday**: do the first two modules of [COMET NWP course](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/training_course.php?id=21). Have quizzes sent to mapes@miami.edu when you make your account.	| [Secondary circulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_flow): concepts and examples.
9-11	|	Current weather (Eta) and consider NWP models (COMET module and beyond). [Final HW assigned](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_2020/blob/master/Exam_and_problems/TakeHomeFinalHW.pdf) for next Monday. Once was a final exam, now just a good view of key points you should know. Bring questions about it Weds or Mon. |

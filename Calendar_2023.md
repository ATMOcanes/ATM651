## Grammar terms in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/167c9hzHmwGoN1B_j-ZskOJ8Ffwu-GBIl4-UckAuDVK4/edit?usp=sharing)
Cover 10 confusing/tricky ones per student -- use LLMs and wikipedia and whatever else to produce a table of vocabulary with definitions in math and words and concepts (sketches) sometimes. The grand table will become the exam, as I erase cells and ask you to fill them in during class exam hour, like [this](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Midterm_Exam_Key.pdf).

Dates	|Monday	|Wednesday
-------|------------- | ------------- 
Aug 21-23 |zoom.earth and phenomenology and scope, [questionnaire](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM_GradDyn_Intake_Questionnaire.docx). Assign [Stuff in Space](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/ShortCourseBook/Chapter1_StuffInSpace.pdf) reading, especially the SI or MKS units and fundamental concepts for now. | Student intros, SI units. Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694). We will use [WH book ch7](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/WallaceHobbs-Ch7.pdf) so you can start reading that. New to Atmospheric Science? Read Wallace-Hobbs chapter 1 [here](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/WallaceHobbs-Ch01.pdf). 
Aug28-30 	| Math review cram! Power of parentheses f(arguments and coordinates). Derivatives. Derivative *operator*. Vectors. *Fields* of scalars and vectors. Nabla, the *vector derivative operator*. Compound units: velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux. *Pressure* is a flux of momentum, as is *stress*! | Mass budget of a control volume, time change = flux in - flux out. Extension to all intensive or *specific* (per unit mass) quantities. **Assignment due next Weds at 11:59pm**: [HW1_vectorfield_sketch_withaxes](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics). Browse the Feynman lectures on vectors, vector fields, & derivatives & integrals. Be punctilious with vectors (lengths, straightness of arrows) on the graph paper. Capture key unfamiliar terms in the midterm jargon doc. 
Week3|LABOR DAY | After a bit of current weather (3-sigma dry-aloft and T850 anomalies), HW1 questions. Then a little bit on TRANSPORT, treated as FLUX CONVERGENCE vs. ADVECTION. 
Sep 11-13 |**HW1 due. Assign HW2 (due next Monday, bring questions Weds).** HW2: please write answers to all the Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 questions, showing and explaining your reasoning. Also, turn in your-own-words responses to (or your articulate questions about) all the Stuff in Space problems (note the answers are given!!) Lecture: Transport (fluxcon vs. advection), [whiteboards](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/Whiteboard_transport_fluxconv_advection.pdf), ; noticing this is all in the Stuff in Space book chapter (clarifying [differentiation notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Partial_derivatives)). |With our now-solid bookkeeping knowledge about transport, we can discuss horizontal [Advection and diffusion](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Files_unsorted/Advection_diffusion.demos.pdf) of gray smoke. HW2 questions? Bring them.|
Sep 18-20 |**HW2 due** by end of day, any last questions? Math-review HW1 back...feedback is individual, please parse it. Email to me, showing you got the point of things I marked wrong or missing, will suffice to upgrade from failing-B to adequate-A. Lecture on the quest for a closed equation set that excludes or 'filters out' sound waves. We will need the First Law of Thermodynamics for air. | **Read Wallace-Hobbs section 7.1 (kinematics).** Prof. Nolan will talk you through [this ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WH_chapter7/Kinematics_WH_7.1.pptx), with the names on tongue depressors to call out people & get to know you, so please do read the material in preparation. |

Ch7 homework problems coming, you may start them without loss of generality. | **Read** balanced flows, WH ch7 through 7.2.7|
Oct 2-4 |**Balanced flow in a hurricane in cylindrical coordinates** Sharan Majumdar [guest lecture](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/tree/master/Gradient_thermal_wind_Sharan). |Thermal wind logic, continued from Wallace and Hobbs and on board **you should be able to think this through from given momentum, to Coriolis, to PGF, to p surface slope, to thickness = temperature and potential temperature**. See [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/WHITEBOARD_PHOTOS/Logics_Thermalwind_CoolCore_Cyclones.pptx). Illustration ("cool core" upper level vortex) in Sep 29 NYC deluge. **ASSIGNMENT FOR MONDAY:** Read WH ch7 on vorticity, watch vorticity [movies](http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html) Parts 1&2. Everyone BRING 1-2 TIME_STAMPED QUESTIONS about the videos to discuss. |

Nov 13-15 | **HW3 back, Assign HW4: Due Nov 27.** This is a pre-project "rhetoric" assignment. On Nov. 27, everyone will have 5 minutes to express one small, compressed diamond of learning. YOU define & explain a dynamical question of interest, and address it with screenshared presentation (slides or a notebook). **Choices:** 0. Rossby wave dispersion & downstream development: summarize an [ATM407 ppt](https://miami.box.com/s/np0eny880yb69szaozn7ksiwvjkyvqsk). 1. Do a MSE-plots analysis (talking through logic correctly) of a skyscape, as per last lecture, using the Colab notebook above. 2. Extend the Python examples [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/ATMOcanes/ATM651/tree/master/Jupyter_Notebooks_Python/)to address any of several questions suggested at the bottom of Spherical_currentweather.ipynb or KEbudget_currentweather.ipynb (or your own question). (If you don't to install free miniconda on your machine and download & run these, you can run them on Colab using example package installs in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cwVWzP4F_iynK9TjNJCy0GmB1VO-lbWm?usp=sharing).  | Recap on board: Gathering up our soundproof equation sets: Primitive, Boussinesq, Anelastic. List of pre-computer tractable stabs at them. **1. take curl** --> vorticity. **2. V.dV/dt** = d/dt(V.V/2) = d/dt(KE). **3. Simplest solutions:** internal gravity waves (neglecting f), or inertio-gravity (with f...recall that Coriolis force is an "inertial" acceleration) [ppt](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Assembling_the_PEs/Gravitywaves.pptx).

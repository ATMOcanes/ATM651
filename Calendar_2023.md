# Calendar (reported) 

## Ongoing assignment (unitl midterm): collect your 10 key grammar terms in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/167c9hzHmwGoN1B_j-ZskOJ8Ffwu-GBIl4-UckAuDVK4/edit?usp=sharing)
At least 10 per student. Before the midterm, you will use chatGPT and wikipedia and whatever else to produce a table of definitions (in math and words). This grand table of terms will become the exam, as I erase cells and ask you to fill them in during class exam hour.

-------|------------- | ------------- 
Aug 21-23 |zoom.earth and phenomenology and scope, [questionnaire](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM_GradDyn_Intake_Questionnaire.docx). Assign [Stuff in Space](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/ShortCourseBook/Chapter1_StuffInSpace.pdf) reading, starting from just the units and fundamentals for now. | Student intros, SI units, power of parentheses T(x,y,z,t), Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694). We will use [WH book ch7](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/WallaceHobbs-Ch7.pdf) so you can start reading that. New to Atmospheric Science? Read Wallace-Hobbs chapter 1 -- a good read anyway. 
Aug28-30 	| Power of parentheses f(arguments and coordinates). Derivatives. Derivative *operator*. Vectors. *Fields* of scalars and vectors. Nabla, the *vector derivative operator*. Compound units: velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux. Mass budget in control volume. Easy extension to all intensive quantities (___ per unit mass). | **Assignment due next Weds**: [HW1](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics) called HW1_vectorfield_sketch_withaxes. It has links to Feynman lectures on vectors, vector fields, and their derivatives & integrals. Study that material as needed, and please really try to get this bookkeeping notation clear in your mind. Try to notice any confusions or questions or frustrations, and try to articulate these in class next Wednesday, where we can go over them. (It is finally due next Wednesday at end of day, or later by arrangement if anyone is struggling). 
Week3|LABOR DAY | **HW1 due at end of day, bring questions to class.** For next Wednesday HW2, please write answers to all the Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 questions, showing your work/reasoning/thinking, along with responses to all the Stuff in Space chapter problems -- just so I may glimpse your mind, your voice, please. Lecture: finish Stuff in Space (clarifying [differentiation notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Partial_derivatives)). With gradient and its divergence, we can discuss [Advection and diffusion](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Files_unsorted/Advection_diffusion.demos.pdf) of gray smoke.

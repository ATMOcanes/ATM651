# Calendar (reported) 

## Ongoing assignment (unitl midterm): collect your 10 key grammar terms in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/167c9hzHmwGoN1B_j-ZskOJ8Ffwu-GBIl4-UckAuDVK4/edit?usp=sharing)
At least 10 per student. Before the midterm, you will use chatGPT and wikipedia and whatever else to produce a table of definitions (in math and words). This grand table of terms will become the exam, as I erase cells and ask you to fill them in during class exam hour.

Aug 21-23 |zoom.earth and phenomenology and scope, [questionnaire](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics/ATM_GradDyn_Intake_Questionnaire.docx). Assign [Stuff in Space](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/ShortCourseBook/Chapter1_StuffInSpace.pdf) reading, especially the SI or MKS units and fundamental concepts for now. | Student intros, SI units. Here is a great [Penn State math & concepts refresher](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo300/node/694). We will use [WH book ch7](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/WallaceHobbs-Ch7.pdf) so you can start reading that. New to Atmospheric Science? Read Wallace-Hobbs chapter 1 -- a good read anyway. 
Aug28-30 	| Math review cram! Power of parentheses f(arguments and coordinates). Derivatives. Derivative *operator*. Vectors. *Fields* of scalars and vectors. Nabla, the *vector derivative operator*. Compound units: velocity, momentum, force, pressure, energy, work or power, flux. *Pressure* is a flux of momentum, as is *stress*! | Mass budget of a control volume, time change = flux in - flux out. Extension to all intensive or *specific* (per unit mass) quantities. **Assignment due next Weds at 11:59pm**: [HW1_vectorfield_sketch_withaxes](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Week1-2_basics). Browse the Feynman lectures on vectors, vector fields, & derivatives & integrals. Be punctilious with vectors (lengths, straightness of arrows) on the graph paper. Capture key unfamiliar terms in the midterm jargon doc. 
Week3|LABOR DAY | **HW1 due at end of day, bring questions to class.** For next Wednesday HW2, please write answers to all the Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 questions, showing your work/reasoning/thinking, along with your won-words responses to (or articulate questions about) all the Stuff in Space problems (note the answers are given!!)  I just want to glimpse your thinking style, your voice and words. Lecture: finish Stuff in Space (clarifying [differentiation notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Partial_derivatives)). With gradient and its divergence, we can discuss [Advection and diffusion](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651/blob/master/Files_unsorted/Advection_diffusion.demos.pdf) of gray smoke.
